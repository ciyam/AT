Use Case: Atomic Cross-Chain Transfer
-------------------------------------

An AT that enables an atomic cross-chain transfer to be executed by creating two separate instances of itself
on two seperate blockchains. When constructing the first instance a 32 byte secret needs to be "hashed" using
SHA256 and stored in the first 32 bytes of "initial data" followed by another 32 bytes for the address of the
other party, and then the number of minutes to wait until refunding the AT's balance back to its creator.

The initial creator would then wait for the other party to create a matching AT (with a significantly smaller
number of minutes for refund). The hash values would need to be identical. Once the initiator has seen enough
confirmations of the other AT then they will send the secret to the other AT as a message. This AT will first
copy this message into its data storage and then check if when hashed it matches the initial data values that
were provided when it was created. If they match then the funds are sent to the address stored in the initial
data.

Finally the creator of the second AT can now work out from checking their AT's state what the secret is. They
would then send a message to the originally created AT instance with the same secret and it would pay them so
the atomic cross-chain transfer will be completed.

Note that if the second party never actually creates their AT then the first party just needs to wait for the
refund to occur. Likewise once the second party has created their AT then if the first party fails to send it
the secret on time then a refund will occur (and the first party will also be refunded). The first party will
need to be careful not to send the secret too close to the deadline otherwise there is the possibility that a
refund will occur in the second AT but the secret will have already been seen in the message tx.

Another concern is possible attacks by "clogging the AT" up with tiny false message txs to try and prevent it
from paying out. This is perhaps best prevented by making sure that the minimum fee for the ATs is well above
anything that would permit such an attack to be economically beneficial.

The algorithm described at https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Atomic_cross-chain_trading (which the Bitcointalk forum
member TierNolan first designed) is what this AT performs (although it doesn't need multisig addresses as the
ATs take over the role of being escrows).
