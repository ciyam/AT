Automated Transactions API Specification
----------------------------------------

This specification details the AT API which is what allows an AT to communicate with its host's blockchain to
find out details about blocks and transactions relevant to the AT and to issue its own transactions. In order
to write "portable" ATs (i.e. those that can run analtered across different kinds of blockchain platforms) it
is required that only the functions in the range 0x0100 to 0x04ff be used. Experimental functions can be used
when prototyping (and have no formal definition here) and platform specific functions can be defined in order
for ATs to be able to work more efficiently on a specific platform (and also have no formal definition here).

As the AT machine uses a 64 bit design some very useful API commands such as cryptographic hash functions are
not able to be perfomed directly with machine addresses. To work around this problem without resorting to the
API having to perform memory range testing to use the AT's data, a set of "pseudo registers" must be provided
by the AT API (every AT instance needs its own set) that are initially set to zero.

There are four 64 bit registers called A1..4 and another four called B1..4 for this purpose (also referred to
as two 256 bit registers called A and B). It is important to note that the A and B pseudo registers will need
to be stored along with the other "state" variables such as the program counter and stack counters.

Note that "timestamp" does not mean a real timestamp but instead is an artificial timestamp that includes two
parts. The first part is a block height (32 bits) with the second part being the number of the transaction if
applicable (also 32 bits and zero if not applicable).

Note also that functions can be identified as being "blocking" functions. They will cause the AT to sleep for
X blocks when it is known that the function will then be ready to return (with the function being executed by
the AT twice with the first call needing to rewind the AT's program counter before putting it to sleep).

In order to keep the functions organised in groups function number ranges are as follows:

Number Range      Range Usage
--------------    ----------------------------------------------
0x0000..0x000f    Reserved for internal AT testing purposes
0x0010..0x00ff    Experimental API function calls (for prototyping)
0x0100..0x01ff    Get/Set functions for "pseudo registers"
0x0200..0x02ff    Functions that perform hash operations
0x0300..0x03ff    Generic functions that get block and tx info
0x0400..0x04ff    Generic functions that check balances and perform ops
0x0500..0x05ff    Platform specific functions that get block and tx info
0x0600..0x06ff    Platform specific functions that check balances and perform ops

As cryptographic hash operations are *expensive* operations it is suggested that the "fee" for each of those
function calls be higher than that of others (fees themselves are a platform specific implementation issue).

 * tx type is 0 for a normal tx and 1 for a message tx
 ** amount will always have the minimum fee subtracted from it
 *** a random id is a 64 bit signed value (that is always returned positive) and this is a blocking function
 **** if the tx does not include a message tx then this will zero out the B value

 NOTE: For all cases where A is not a valid tx @addr will be set to 0xffffffffffffffff

Add_Minutes_To_Timestamp  0x0406 EXT_FUN_RET_DAT_2 set @addr1 to timestamp $addr2 plus $addr3 minutes***

 * this amount does not include any additional amounts sent to the AT between "execution events"
 ** if this amount is greater than the AT's balance then it will only send the current balance amount
 *** the API is expected to base this timestamp according to the "average block time" for the blockchain
